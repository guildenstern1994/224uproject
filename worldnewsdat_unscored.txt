I actually watched it fly over for this orbit.

Funny thing is, i didn't even realize it was the ISS at first.

I saw a light moving across the sky, and after a bit, decided to google the current location of the ISS. Sure enough, right overhead.

Also turns out that it was on the 100,000th orbit.

What a coincidence!

First, I'm not your pal, friend.     

And second, you Shirley can't be serious with this:   
>prosecutions for those who say things about Israel   

Have you read the press in the last six months or so regarding Israel? Go to the Zeit, Süddeutsche, Spiegel Online or FAZ and search for "Israel" and I'll guarantee you that you will find plenty of criticism.   
Not without reason is Germany still number 14 on the [World Press Freedom index](https://rsf.org/en/ranking#); above other countries who are supposed to have less restrictions to free speech.   
Which brings me to:
>Germany (and France and many other countries) are inclined towards fascism, as evidenced by their ongoing efforts to repress speech based on its content.   

There is literally NO country (well, maybe Sealand) on this planet that doesn't have some kind of restrictions to free speech, and by your definition all these countries are slowly becoming fascist dictatorships?   
I can totally agree that the blasphemy laws and [§103](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/103.html) are no longer relevant for todays society and should be abolished, but "inclined towards fascism"? Really? Because you can't always insult everybody in public?

One constant is the cry about subsidies for renewables from the carbon sector. This from an industry that puts half of its garbage up the smokestack, and the rest in an ash dump. It is as if the nuclear industry could talk about the cost of nuclear and never mention disposing of the radiation waste.

Coal does not pay for the cost of the cadmium, lead and other heavy metals generated and dispersed around where it is burned. Coal does not pay for the environmental cost of coal mining. Coal does not pay for the cumulative effect of dumping millions of tons of CO2 into the common atmosphere of everybody. 

So why do figures from coal industry sources about the cost of generation (figures that don't take health, environmental and mining costs into account) have to be taken at face value? What is sacred about coal that it doesn't have to account for these costs in the figures used to calculate the cost of electricity?

I agree that all countries don't perfectly share information so by strict definition they are tax havens such as the U.S. with its strict privacy laws on various industries such as tax and banking. 


I understand where the miscommunication is. Specifically, what I am focusing my thoughts on is tax havens in jurisdictions with little or no tax. In my prior comments I didn't qualify that. 

In the little or no tax jurisdictions they aggressively provide privacy for individuals and corporations that hold assets in the respective territories. They do not have treaties and tax information exchange agreements with foreign governments providing a veil of secrecy that help those individuals illegally evade taxes. 

I disagree with your last statement on taxation of income. Regarding U.S. taxation laws all citizens and resident aliens are taxed on worldwide income regardless of where your income is earned. 

That is the issue of criminality when a US Citizen or Resident opens up foreign bank accounts they are required to report income from those accounts to U.S. taxing authorities such as the IRS. The veil of secrecy provides them the opportunity not to report their income to the IRS. Depending on intent as proven in a court of law it could be criminal. 


In America all banks and companies operating are required to report your earnings to the IRS. The IRS matches that income to your tax return and taxes you on any discrepancies. Banks and companies are subject to penalties for failing to correctly report income information. In a foreign tax haven with little or no tax the banks and companies do not disclose your earnings to the IRS. Thus if you do not report them to the IRS they don't know and you effectively evade taxes.

> Calling everybody you disagree with a racist bigot

So I'm a bigot because I called a racist person racist? Or because I said people are supporting a racist? Don't you think if someone is labeling people with false accusations, that person is practically a racist?

I'm not calling people of US "racist bigots". I'm saying Trump is a racist, which everyone can see. I'm not the one who is trying to build a wall to stop other people coming to my country. I'm not saying muslims should be banned from entering my country. But Trump says these, and he gets votes. Which is what i said.

Now you tell me, do you think I'm a bigot if I say Hitler and Nazis were racists? 

No. Because this is a fact. Just like that, Trump is a racist and he is using current problems with other nations to win the elections. And people like him because he is a talkative and entertaining racist. And a rich one.

What worries me is even if he lose the elections, his voters will remember what he said about "the others". They will remember it is "the others" who sending drugs,criminals and rapists to US. "The others" are terrorists. And this "other people" will also remember what americans said about them. Mexicans will say "They think we are drug addicts, rapists, criminals.". Muslims will say "Americans thinks we all terrorists, they see all of us as enemies." This is how hatred spreads between nations. Therefore I'm against this.

So you see buddy, I'm not calling americans bigots. I'm not intolerant towards them. But if someone does so, he is the real bigot.

> Do you realize how many tools it takes to create a modern cpu? It takes infrastructure on a global scale and you're casually dismissing it as an easy problem. If you don't create new cpu's, how long until the old ones wear out and you simply don't have computers? Probably a few decades at best.

Actually I do and it doesn't take infrastructure from around the world It takes materials from around the world - which can be stockpiled. Likewise computer components can be stockpiled and the modern CPU isn't necessarily the first choice for the enclosed environment.

>Are you suggesting indoor farming on the scale capable of meeting our needs for rubber, plastics, medicines, food and all of the other critical plants we currently use? Do you really think that's realistic? How many miles of underground farms do you think is possible?

As much as you have energy to power and tunnels cut. There isn't a limit. Besides, we didn't establish how many people will live there.

Plans for martian hydroponics facilities multiply the efficiency of flat farmland with terraced crops and you need about 500 square meters per person per year normally so I'd say about 100x100x50 meter growing area with a new tier every meter could supply 750 people given 15% empty space and some excess.

>It's just statistics.

So unrealistic.

>I think you missed my point. Whatever equipment they start with, they need to be able to make more of.

Equipment that works with equipment to build equipment including itself. With redundancy and excess materials you're set. That's literally just a matter of planning ahead.

A despotic theocracy based on a 1400 year old fictional story book is doing something that Westerners deem "non progressive"...yeah, in other news the Earth rotates around the Sun.

I can agree with you. I agree that all countries don't perfectly share information so by strict definition they are tax havens such as the U.S. with its strict privacy laws on various industries such as tax and banking. 

I understand where the miscommunication is. Specifically, what I am focusing my thoughts on is tax havens in jurisdictions with little or no tax. In my prior comments I didn't qualify that. In the little or no tax jurisdictions they aggressively provide privacy for individuals and corporations that hold assets in the respective territories. They do not have treaties and tax information exchange agreements with foreign governments providing the veil of secrecy that help those individuals illegally evade taxes.

If I can give a suggestion...

Move up the east Midlands mainline :) We moved to Kettering last year, and it works out stupidly cheap for a house or a flat around here, compared to London. Yearly travel tickets are around 8k (with zones 1-6 and bus travel included) - which is the only big expense. But when you consider you can get a 4 bedroom house for 220k, can walk to a relatively quiet station, get a seat on the train, and spend only 55 minutes to Kings Cross, it's not half bad.

I used to commute from Uxbridge, and it took longer to commute 8 miles into central from Uxbridge than it does to commute 100 miles from Kettering. It's mad. The east Midlands mainline is getting an electrification upgrade too which should see travel times to London cut to just over 40 minutes.

Ah, yes. That goes back to the age old concept of "spoils of war", and who really owns those spoils. If American courts agreed with the argument that the property stolen from the people of Peru was a sound legal one, then the US court system would also have to appreciate that anything they (America) ever took/stole by government-supported military force, like for example taking and laying claim to their entire nation of "America", which was mostly taken via force (or threat thereof) from various native indigenous tribes who were living there before European arrival for example, could and should be now taken away from the current settlers and instead have ownership returned to the rightful first settlers. Definitely a very difficult and potentially dangerous geo-political and geo-legal precedent to get into! 

The US courts did not want to tread into that BIG can of worms, so determined that since Spain took the property and got it aboard their military vessel (which then was headed for home to Cádiz, Spain and was sunk by the British en route), the property was still rightfully Spain's - even though it was not technically a "spoils of war" prize, since England and Spain were at peace at the time of the English sinking her. There is a lot of nuance that makes this case of the *Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes* an interesting one to study, and whether we agree with the US court ruling or not, the reality is that they ruled the way they did against Odyssey in this case because of geo-political, geo-military, geo-economic, and geo-legal reasons, and for the fear of introducing precedent into case law within the USA that could perhaps later be cited and used against America.

> intent is already a part of sentencing

actually, intent is not simply part of sentencing, but part of the decision what charges are to be brought forth during a formal complaint.  that's why there are 1st/2nd deg murder, vol/invol manslaughter.  all are differentiated by varying degrees of intent and premeditation.  

i think when intent is motivated by prejudiced based on ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, etc, that steps it up to a even more serious crime.

an example 1st degree murder is a guy killing his wife after plotting her death when he finds out she's cheating on him.  IMO, i think when a guy goes and kills a woman in a fit of rage simply because he saw her wearing a hijab, that'd only be a 2nd degree murder, but i think it's just as fucked up as the prior, and should be escalated by the distinction of a hate crime.

> Laws should not rely on the people enforcing them having common sense or decency.

wtf, this is completely ridiculous.  That is exactly what the judicial system is built for.....  law is to be interpreted by judges... that's actually the very basis of their job.  Cops are supposed to exercise their best judgement based on their training to execute their duties in apprehending suspected criminals.  it should absolutely rely on the people enforcing them.  which is exactly why it's a clusterfuck right now because people DO rely on cops' judgments and a lot of idiots are being hired.

How do you worry about a "genocide" that isn't happening?

If Israel wanted a genocide, it wouldn't kill less than 1 civilian per 15 explosive shells fired. It wouldn't knock on roofs, text civilians, and drop warning leaflets. It wouldn't use targeted weapons at all.

It wouldn't provide more than 1/3 of Gaza's electricity and water, and same to the West Bank.

If you think there's a genocide going on, you're wrong. Dangerously wrong. Any group whose people have experienced an actual genocide would beg to differ with you.

At this point it's an excuse for past behavior; the ADL is heading for the right side of history at last.

In my opinion, the biggest difference between diplomatic reluctance to recognize the Armenian genocide and Holocaust denial is typically that the former typically doesn't ignore a historical reality and revolves chiefly around definitions, whereas the latter typically ignores definitions and instead refuses to acknowledge what happened.

Another difference is that postwar German freely admitted what happened, whereas Turkey has historically tried to dodge culpability. It's trivially easy to nod agreement to a mea culpa.

At the end of the day this is the problem when peoples cultural or religious backgrounds are incompatible with the national average.

You can try to patch it up all you like - extremism laws, school regulations, anti-FGM laws etc., - it's not going to be easy if there are too many people with these incompatible cultural and religious beliefs. They have come from outside the country, some of them are _nth_ generation, it's a mess for everyone.

I suggest we accept the people who are currently here, and take more care to vet new people who come into this country in the future. It's not like we have a problem with illegal French schools teaching kids to hate British food. This is a specific problem of certain religions and cultures teaching their kids to hate us, hate gay people and hate everything we stand for.

First of all, I'm not you buddy, pal.

Second, Germany has several laws that restrict the scope of free speech.  For example, it is illegal to say anything or make any art that would be an "incitement of the masses".

Those standards, however, are applied very inconsistently, and based on subjective evaluation of the content of the speech.  Thus, while the law is drafted in a way that appears unbiased on its face, in practice it is used to punish some viewpoints and not used against others.

That is why you will see prosecutions for those who say things about Israel, but very seldom see prosecutions for those who say things about Muslims.  The German government wants to protect Israel against having its feelings hurt (if that is even possible... after all it is a state, not a person), but doesn't care if Muslims are insulted, even if those statements are actually likely, by an objective measure, more likely to incite people to violence.

Personally, I advocate no restrictions on speech based on the content.  Only by allowing people to say stupid things in public, subject to public debate and ridicule, do those dumb arguments lose their power.  By punishing speech based on content, you inadvertently give those same bad ideas a patina of legitimacy, because some people will fall for the argument that the government wouldn't try to repress the ideas if they weren't true.

In short, I was pointing out that Germany (and France and many other countries) are inclined towards fascism, as evidenced by their ongoing efforts to repress speech based on its content.

I know you mean well, but you're missing the point. The German federal government has been eyeing this million new people who have come intto the country greedily ever since they started arriving. All these young men will become taxpayers and give a huge boost to the German federal budget.

> First, it makes sense to only take skilled migrants that can boost your economy, but only when dealing with economic migrants.

Typical Western immigration policies are designed around that principle. What is overlooked by those who design those policies, though, is that a highly skilled person can go anywhere in the world; that worker will have no sense of loyalty to your country if he comes. Which people *will* feel enough loyalty enough to stick around? Those who your country takes in and trains. This is why Germany and certain other European countries for many years have offered nearly free university training to foreigners from all over the world. 

I was just in Japan for a year, and the way Japanese companies recruit, reflects the same ethic. They don't care very much about what you studied at university. They look for personal character and work ethic, and they want to train you when you arrive and start working at their company.  That's why workers become so famously loyal to their companies. Certainly, we hear a lot about the long hours at Japanese companies, but it happens because of this inner drive that comes from this sense of loyalty.

The logic seems retarded to **you** since you are looking at things from an ethical (and moral) perspective. The very same logic appears fantastic to the Iranian government since in their point of view, religious values are important, and very essential to building a modest country where lust and perversion are kept at bay as much ass possible. 

Is that logic really retarded? No universally-accepted answer, sadly. It really depends on how you prioritize your values and beliefs, as individuals, and as governments. 

Western societies would most probably call the approach "retarded" since frequent sexalization of women is an acceptable norm that happens in the media everyday.

Most middle-eastern societies, due to their religious beliefs, have chosen to minimize females sexalization as much as possible. To them, the very same approach (of covering up their females) does not seem retarded at all.

> Nazi

have ever heard the song? 

have you even read up on the history of the deportation? Yes, whole lot of 200,000+ people somehow sided with Germans (almost an army group worth of people, by the German military standards of that time), so they all were sent out in train cars without food or water and as a result - almost half of them died (thousands of children included). This deportation is widely regarded as an example of [ethnic cleansing.](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/annihilation-9780199683048?cc=ua&lang=en&).

Yes, these people definitely deserved the whole ordeal, since you know a dozen or two of them decided to side with the Nazis. 

I wonder why Stalin didn't deport as many Russians elsewhere, since at least 150,000 thousand of them were ACTUALLY fighting for the Nazis, as part of the Russian Liberation Army (I'm not even talking about other similar organizations). 

Your argument has no merit, as it somehow tries to justify what Stalin ordered.

For the record, that's twice the entire Saudi's commission (aka religious police) number. That's why Iran is really scary in comparison to Saudi for me as an outsider. In Saudi the commission's guys are plain obvious with their distinctive grooming and attire, you could spot them a mile away, there aren't that many of them anyway, and you know where they tend to loiter (some malls/markets etc). They're also fairly comical figures and plenty of people talk back at them and debate them and even shut them up. Not really scary at all (google countless videos of people - women included - calling them out on their bullshit in person). Whereas in Iran by comparison, the Basij and plentiful (claimed to number in the millions by the regime), are disguised, could be anyone, some of them are armed (guns, some even machine guns), and a much scarier prospect. They also have as their backup the revolutionary guards. That's hell scary.

>Why can't you bring the tools to make more tools?

Do you realize how many tools it takes to create a modern cpu?  It takes infrastructure on a global scale and you're casually dismissing it as an easy problem.  If you don't create new cpu's, how long until the old ones wear out and you simply don't have computers?  Probably a few decades at best.

>Because global warming blew up the many hardened underground global seed vaults designed to survive the apocalypse?

Are you suggesting indoor farming on the scale capable of meeting our needs for rubber, plastics, medicines, food and all of the other critical plants we currently use?  Do you really think that's realistic?  How many miles of underground farms do you think is possible?

>Because society (...)

It's just statistics.  Right now we have billions of people creating millions of scientists.  If our global population were lower, we would have lower numbers of scientists.  I'm pointing out that it's not enough to survive a few decades.  Our current level of technology is only where it is because we've leveraged the planet's resources to get here.  We won't continue to advance using a fraction of our current population and resources.

>Because giving them (...)

I think you missed my point.  Whatever equipment they start with, they need to be able to make more of.  Otherwise it will wear out.  Right now we take it for granted that we can just buy a new hard drive, so we do.  You're talking about being able to make new hard drives.  I don't think you understand the level of technology it takes to build a hard drive.  Our technology factories are bigger than some cities.  Technology requires resources including rare metals found scattered across the globe.

You can say I lack imagination, but I think you lack an appreciation for how difficult things would be without our current advanced level of manufacturing.  That's not something a few million people can pack up and take with us.

Again, since you don't know the history around this please refrain from speaking on the subject. This is a very complicated piece of history and has nothing to do with racism. It was very much political in nature, a mini civil war with riots targeting a community by a single party. The very same party that had a Sikh PM less than 2 years ago in India. Please go ahead and read operation blue star. 

>Bangladesh war? 

Are you fucking kidding me?
India stepped in to stop a genocide of 3 million people. You rambling clearly proves not only that you are ignorant but a rambling fool.

>No country is without a history of racism, my point is that NOW we have started to reach a point of full recognition that it is wrong. 

Please tell me where I stated that? Also, are you justifying that Belgium cutting the hands of Africans should be forgiven? Are you claiming to be the spokesman for the people who have died at the hands of British policies? Are you claiming that the lives of Bengalis during the WW2 was lass important than their European counter parts when food from famine struck Bengal was shipped to Europe? Are you their representative? The sins of the empire were never forgiven, we have accepted to move past them, but no forgotten. 

>Your candid dismissal of 30 million peoples deaths in China was not as bad as colonialism or imperialism shows your true lack of understanding


According to estimates, the number of deaths range from 400,000 to 3 millions. Not sure where you are getting that number from. Those numbers are spread over 20 years. Whereas famine in India in less than 1 year killed off 3 million people. That is just one example. If you really are Indian, learn your damn history before making a fool of yourself. I have just given the facts on India on one incident. If you started to look at the others the death toll reaches pretty high. Lets not forget the genocide of native Americans as well.

Lastly, let's not forget this is the same country that has recently pulled out 700million people out of poverty something that has never been done before in human history. It doesn't and will never negate the cultural revolution.

And your argument is, let's not fix things that we know works in other countries, and go straight ahead into implementing drastic measures immediately. The USA was ranked number one in quality by the very sources you used to say we spend more than other countries. It will be inevitable that this quality will decrease if we take dramatic measures. Over 9,000 UK ESRD patients died because they were on a waiting list for dialysis under the NHS system. In the U.S.? 0. Medicare will pay for it for their lifetime treatments, and there are enough dialysis centers to handle the load. Paperwork is the least of my concerns when it comes to it.

The matter of the fact is doctors and hospitals can refuse government insured patients. Just like what one of the largest providers in Oregon did. Keep charging $12/patient visit, and no doctor will take in these hordes of patients once you give single-payer to all. In some regions of Canada, there is only one primary care doctor per 1100 patients. 

Instead, I am an absolute fan of the Singapore system, which has time and time again ranked number 1 in terms of efficiency, healthcare spending, and outcomes. The government's "invisible" hand forces the people to save money for healthcare by taking a % of their paycheck and putting it into a health savings account. They enforce price transparency, so all hospitals must make their prices available for the people to shop around with, causing competition and fair use of prices. For those who are poor, there is a social safety net (Medisave). And for those who don't want to wait too long, want elective services, or want higher quality care, there is the option of private insurance. How come we aren't looking at the number one rated country, but the only options are systems from Morocco, Colombia, Norway, or the UK? Granted, the Singapore system had an advantage of implementing this recently by INTEGRATING everything that worked best for each country.

That's the thing - if you're spending your own money looking for this stuff, and then take it for your own, you might as well be robbing a museum. Might as well argue that if I spent my own money getting all the equipment I need to steal stuff from a museum, I should get to keep what I take. It's despicable, and it makes me furious whenever I read these threads and see so many people saying 'they should have just kept it quiet and kept it for themselves.' That approach has destroyed more historical data then you could possibly imagine.

And no, of course I don't think that. It was hyperbole. I do think, however, that it should be illegal to possess artifacts beyond a certain age without them being accounted for first by a museum, unless they've been in circulation ever since that time.

CEOs and the 1% aren't some magical class. There are millions of people just as smart or smarter to fill a handful(1%) of positions.

>Business leaders aren't easy people to replace. That's why they get paid so damned much. If there were enough people to replace them all and for things to be "just fine" after, then these people wouldn't get paid the amounts they do. This is because the supply of people who are fit for these positions would outweigh the demand and thus the price companies are willing to pay would be lower. 

There are new startups every day. "Business leader" isn't some special class of person. They are paid a lot because of the responsibility they have, not because they're special one-off human beings. Executives must produce to stay, and the buck stops with them when things go wrong.


>Obviously the 1% who are simply there because of inheritance and who do not have any particular skills and don't attribute anything to the economy won't be sorely missed, economically speaking. But to say that all business leaders and entrepreneurs are easy to replace is fucking silly. It's simply not true.

There are billions of people, everyone is replaceable. Whatever you did, there someone else in the world who would have done better given the same opportunity. Leading a business isn't some mysterious unlearnable voodoo that only the 1% has.

The Turks and Armenians need to revisit their past. The Jewish community shouldn’t be the arbiter of that history. And I don’t think the U.S. Congress should be the arbiter, either.

When the journalist stated the Armenian Genocide is recognised as a historical fact by historians and Congress recognises all sorts of historical events such as the Holocaust, Foxman's response was:

I definitely get your point, and agree to a certain extent. I think Odyssey should have at least been given some form of financial recompense from Spain for the fact that they discovered the wreck's location, and that they spent a lot of time and effort and money and risk identifying the wreck, and salvaging its silver and gold stash. Odyssey did not know what wreck they had found initially, but only discovered that identification through forensic exam of other items found in the wreck they recovered from the sea floor in the process of examining it.

If they wanted to be assholes about it, Odyssey could/should have actually kept their mouth shut about the discovery and never gone public about it, and then salvaged it without blatantly admitting that they had found the wreck of the *Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes* publicly. Had they done that - not publicly declared that they had located and were salvaging what they discovered was a Spanish-flagged military vessel - and instead just salvaged the silver and gold from it privately and then sold that recovered treasure privately or publicly without ever disclosing the wreckage location or the ID of the ship, they might have been able to get away with keeping 100% of the profits from the recovery effort. Someone (the Spanish government in this case) would have had to mount their own salvage/exploratory investigation in order to prove the ship was theirs. Odyssey in this case did that work for Spain however, in the process effectively "shooting themselves in the foot" by giving Spain all the evidence needed to prove the vessel ID, and that it indeed belonged to Spain at the time of sinking.

Some are more difficult like manufacturing, but building tools that make tools and parts to repair tools is hardly impossible and have already been accomplished. Making robust systems for the task would take planning but nothing we weren't capable of in the 80's.

The reason that the argument you pointed out did not work was that while the vessel's cargo was indeed taken from Peru, at the time of its sinking Peru was not recognized as an entirely sovereign independent nation state. Peru was actually recognized internationally as a Spanish colony at the time (in the year 1804) that the ship sank.
 
Odyssey Marine Exploration's lawyers in this case actually attempted to argue that very point you raised in front of the US Federal Courts when the trial took place, but the argument that Spain held no legal right to the wreckage or its contents was denied because Peru was still deemed a Spanish colony at the time of sinking.

Long story short: Reza Shah banned the chador and headscarf in 1936. He wanted to modernize and Westernize Iran and believed that Islamic dress was at odds with this goal. He had police that would forcibly remove a woman's headscarf, veil, or chador. Observant Muslim women would stay locked in their house rather than leave in what they believed to be immodest dress. 

Reza Shah abdicated in 1941 and was replaced by his son, Mohammad Reza Shah. The new Shah stopped the practice of forcibly removing women's headscarves and veils. However, he was so pro-modernization and so pro-westernization that the headscarf and veil were strongly discouraged. Wearing one could prevent you from attending school, entering public buildings, getting a job, could hold back your husband in his career, etc. So they were pretty uncommon.

In 1979, the Islamic Revolution occured and the Shah left Iran. Ruholla Khomeini took control of the country and imposed Islamic law.

So? Why can't you bring the tools to make more tools? Mine a landfill or Dig Deeper and More Greedily.

>A polar city would need factories capable of producing everything from steel and shoes to plastics and cpu's. The resources we currently use to make these things come from all over the world, how would we collect them if the surface is virtually uninhabitable?

Therefore our ambitions to colonize other planets are for naught? Does uninhabitable mean impossible to venture across?

>A lot of the resources we use now come from plants that wouldn't even exist anymore.

Because global warming blew up the many hardened underground global seed vaults designed to survive the apocalypse?

>Not to mention genetics and education. We're making great scientific advancements right now because a few million (out of a few billion) of us become scientists and engineers. If you cut the initial pool down to a few hundred thousand/few million, suddenly you have a few hundred scientists.

Because society in a continuity of species situation is identical to the society that just rendered the earth uninhabitable?

>That's it. Good luck making any progress, you're almost certainly going backwards at that point. Archiving current levels of knowledge would be another challenge, because things would only get worse over time as things like hard drives fail in the next few decades. lol, it's hard to imagine a polar society even being able to make new hard drives at all.

Because giving them the means to be self sustaining actually means giving them substandard equipment, protocol, and information storage technologies that would easily be crippled and not made of failsafes upon failsafes?

You are trying to sound like a smart-ass, but it really is not as simple as that. Starts with hair, and then other body parts will get their turn. You end up with a society where women are seen merely as sexual objects. Women don't show off their body, and a vast majority of the men will not express pervert behavior. As you can see, expecting females to cover up their sexual attractiveness is Iran's way of keeping lust at bay. Now, is that the best way to solve this problem? That depends on your individual beliefs and values. But those running the country certainly do think it is.

The US has this thing they call the [Community Reinvestment Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Reinvestment_Act).

The way it works is that banks must loan the deposits they get in a community to the people living in that community. Suppose there's a supermarket in a neighborhood. That supermarket has an account at the bank. The money in the account must be used to give financing to people in that same neighborhood.

Sounds fine? Ever heard of "junk mortgages"? That's the way it went. 

The banks, forced by the regulations to lend money to people who couldn't possibly pay back, dealt with the situation the best they could, by creating hedge funds to protect them against defaults. But the situation couldn't last forever, so in 2008 the bubble burst.

If London thinks they can do better than the market, it's their funeral.

Islam sees the Quran as an immutable holy text, literally the direct word of their god received through Muhammad and the angel Gabriel. The bible was officially written by humans, not a divine being or a divine being "speaking through" someone or whatever. In other words in Islam reforming or even reinterpreting the Quran would be like if the church decided to change the 10 commandments to include "homosexuality is totes cool btw", editing something that they believe to be the literal word and law of their God, it would fundamentally contradict everything their religion was built on. Same as if Islam is asked to "change islam" or "adapt to the times".

We do. Unfortunately, the leaders of our home countries—and other such men of authority—don't. 

[There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.](http://quran.com/2/256) (Qur'an 2:256)

[And say, "The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve."](http://quran.com/18/28)(Qur'an 18:29)

[This whole Surah.](http://quran.com/80) (Qur'an - Surah 80)

[Your Lord is most knowing of you. If He wills, He will have mercy upon you; or if He wills, He will punish you. And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], over them as a manager.](http://quran.com/17/54) (Qur'an 17:54)

No no, lets be honest here. Cheney created fake intel and pushed other officials to give the false intel to Blair. Cheney lied not only to Blair, he lied to Colin Powell and Rumsfeld. In fact, Powell questioned it right up to the presentation at the UN he was told to make, and Rumsfeld was let go for questioning it... because he wasnt a "team player". 

The question is, can they impeach Cheney for lying to British authorities? 

The Brits would not have gone to war if Cheney had not pushed the ficticious intel. Otherwise Blair would have gotten a briefing using the same intel that Powell and Rumsfeld had, and it would have said there was no reason to invade. 

I very much doubt Blair would have invaded without that false intel from Cheney.

I don't think I've ever heard anyone deny that climate change exists. The debate is over whether how much humans contribute to climate change. 

People who are labeled 'climate deniers' are generally the ones who argue from the point that it's mostly a natural cycle with little to no impact from humans. 

The debate tends to go like this:

> Person1: "And this is why we need some increased funding and regulations against big corporations!"

> Person2: "Well, I don't think that all of the assumptions you make are true based on the da...."

> Person1: "CLIMATE DENIER! HE'S A CLIMATE DENIER!"

I adore both cities, but this is going to sound biased anyway. I mean I did move on purpose.

Vancouver is completely preoccupied with its affordable housing situation. r/Vancouver gets lousy with it, but it's also in every newspaper every day. Pretty much everyone agrees something needs to be done, including those who've already got their home and investments. Racism vs Chinese comes up a lot but the majority will reason that it's not about race but money and foreign ownership.

Londoners are proud of their individuality and in a lot of cases that's a great thing. But in London you either own already or you don't. And if you don't, fuck you. It's either your fault because you're lazy, or it's the fault of a brown non-English speaker who stole your job. Pretty much end of story.

Maybe the new mayor will change things. Right now the attitudes are very different. I should mention that Greater Vancouver is about 2.5 million people in 3000 square km whereas Greater London is 8.5 million people in 1500 square km so there's that massive difference, for whatever it means.

YOU: What a non-sensical argument. Many things that are not worthwhile with a price become worthwhile if free.

ME: So, so long as you'd rather spend your money on something else, everything should be free?

I get where you're coming from. You'd rather not have to pay a higher price to rent something you want to casually watch. You'd rather not purchase a movie you may not watch more than once. You'd rather not buy a game or album or whatever before you've already enjoyed it enough to KNOW that it's worth your money.

But I don't agree that it should be up to you to pick and choose which content you're willing to pay for while still consuming it anyhow. It's nice that you're willing to eventually buy something if you get enough play out of it to deem it worth your while, but that doesn't seem right or fair to those involved in creating the works you're enjoying (or at least passively consuming). 

Buy it at a price it is being sold at, or don't. You aren't entitled to something for free just because you deem the cost too high.

You're mistaking China as something it's not. They're not trying to make money, heck there's actually no need for HSR when noone has cars and everyone uses your trains. As for development must be organic and sustainable... There's a reason why ideals are never reached.

1. USA paperwork problem makes Australia paperwork problem look enjoyable in comparison

2. The goal is better, not perfect. You want to hold up adoption of something obviously much lower cost for better or same quality... because it's not perfect?

I'm not gonna give you more links to save you the trouble of looking it up yourself. If you really are this ignorant, (you should have been taught these basic rules of engagement before being deployed), you need to educate yourself. I will not respond to you again because you are clearly not interested in what I have to say. I hope to god noone puts a rifle in your hands again.

> there SHOULD be hate crime laws

In a perfect world, we could design a "hate crime law" that leaves no ambiguity and ensures only the people that should be arrested, will be arrested (even though we already have a complete system of laws that does that, and it would be totally redundant).

In reality, it's impossible to actually give a concrete legal definition to the term "hate crime" that doesn't give the ability to a prosecutor or judge to ruin someone's life for saying something that they personally disagree with.  This isn't the first example.  There was an MP in Sweden who was arrested for saying that there's a "rape culture" in Islamic society.  That might be something you disagree with, it might be something you think is stupid to say, but this guy clearly thought it was important enough to bring up in a calm discussion, and he was fucking *arrested* for it.

Like, in a perfect world, we could design a capital punishment system that only executed people who deserved to die and for whom society is better off without.

In reality, we know that courts make mistakes, and one innocent person executed is worse than 100 guilty people executed.  

Thankfully, most nations are starting to realise this.

> Baha'is never recant their faith and the most devout of Baha'is would readily give up their lives (as seen in Baha'i History).

Ahh another lie, yet Baha'u'llah and Abdu'l-Baha openly posed as Sunni Muslims to the last day of their lives and attended Muslim congregational prayers to save their hide while the poor adherents weren't given this option and once they were killed were used by these leaders to play the victim.

IEDs were the main killer of U.S. soldiers during the Iraq/Afghanistan operations. We really needed these for our people when they were going about their main work in the region.

Hopefully Egypt's people are safer with these. It doesn't stop me from being bitter about the U.S. handing these things off to allies when soldiers were requesting them and getting nothing. 

When they finally did get them, they were forced to soldier bits of metal plating to the bottoms of their humvees because the actual armor protected vehicles were few and far inbetween. They had reports of soldiers lining the inside of their humvees with Kevlar vests to increase blast protection.

I called your claims far-fetched as you can't provide any source to an unheard idea.

> INC was a de facto parliament before independence

What does it even mean? INC had no legislative or judicial power before 1947. Period.

Plus, INC forming a scientific research committee in 1939/42 (again a claim which I can't find anything on googling)  doesn't mean anything since they weren't in the Indian govt (non-existent at the time).

Also, how is forming a scientific research committee equivalent to nuclear research?
